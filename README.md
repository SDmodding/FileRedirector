# FileRedirector
 This will redirect all files that game tries to load from .big file to actual file that's stored under FileRedirector folder.

## Usage
1. You put all files in game folder
2. The folder "RedirectorData" is actual data holder for redirection
3. To redirect any file you need to create actual path to it like the game has it ex. "RedirectorData\UI\hud_texturepack.temp.bin"
4. If you did everything correctly and the name & path is exactly same to the original it should get redirected to new file
